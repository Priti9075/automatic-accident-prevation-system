The Module is useful to stop the Vehicles with the automatic road blocker setup which works according to time lapse in the program which is synchronized with the traffic system. As the Red Traffic Light turns red the road blockers are activated which blocks the road and gives path to pedestrians to pass with the automatic Zebra Crossing. 
This Zebra Crossing provides Disabled people, people in their old age and kids a safe and riskless path without any hassle of crossing the road in limited time.
